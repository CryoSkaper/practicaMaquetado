    </h2>
    <p>
        Please read these Terms of Use ("<b>Terms</b>") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "<b>Spotify Service</b>") and any music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service ("Content").

        Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the <a href="www.random.com">Spotify Privacy Policy<a> and additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are made part of these Terms by this reference.
            
            By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.
            <br>
            <br>
            THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.
